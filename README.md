## Notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a sample mobile app for android that allows
users to filter and save the then filtered photos in the internal storage of their phone. By using
the Glide Transformations library from https://github.com/wasabeef/glide-transformations and 
hooking it up to an easy-to-use interface, users can choose their photo, apply a filter (Sepia, 
Vignetter, Toon, and Invert), and then save the photo. The photo will be save in the downloads 
folder in the phone's internal storage.
